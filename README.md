# EsperantoX #

This chrome extension converts the x-system characters into their proper Esperanto characters.

**This converts the characters live, as you type.**

Example:
cx ⟶ ĉ
gx ⟶ ĝ
hx ⟶ ĥ
jx ⟶ ĵ
sx ⟶ ŝ
ux ⟶ ŭ

## Install ##

Since Chrome extensions are no longer published for Linux / Mac / Windows but only ChromeOS, you will need to do the following :

### Download and extract the extension

At the top of this page you will find a green button named ***Clone or download*** click on it.
On the panel that appears, click ***Download ZIP***.

Once downloaded, find the file on your computer.
You should have the option to extract it after making a right click on it.
Once extracted, you will have to have a new folder, which corresponds to the extension.

### Activate developer mode of your browser based on Chromium

Write ***chrome://extensions*** in the address bar and validate.
Check the box at the top right named ***Developer mode***.

### Add extension to your browser

Click the Load unpacked extension button and specify the location of the extension folder you obtained in the first step.
The extension is now ready for use (the icon added in the address bar).
